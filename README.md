# Krystal Script
## A Modern Alternative To Shell Scripting

### About Krystal Script
Krystal Script was born out of a burning desire inside me to simplify shell scripting for beginners.
When I first moved to linux as a kid, I had a huge problem-I knew nothing about shell scripting and how to use the terminal.

This got my linux journey off to a rocky start and it took me a long time before I even dared open the terminal.

Hence, I decided to create a modern, easy to use alternative for shell scripting: Krystal Script.

### Purpose:
Krystal Script was not created as a replacement for bash.
The whole idea behind this project is to reduce the learning curve for beginners.

In Krystal Script the code is written in english.

The code you write in Krystal Script gets translated to native shell commands and a `.sh` file is produced, if you are on linux, otherwise a `.bat` file is produced.

You can then run these files, or pass it onto others.


## Features

- English like syntax
- Can produce both `.sh` and `.bat` files
- Supports interop with regular shell commands
- Write once, transpile to both linux and windows
- Open Source ðŸ˜‰

## Limitations
Krystal Script is only a psuedo-language. What I mean is that-Krystal Script uses Regex to parse the code and translate it into shell script.
And because of that the parsing capabilities of the transpiler are somewhat limited. Hence, the syntax has to strictly be followed.
Terse one-liners aren't really doable in Krystal Script.
But, sticking to the syntax improves redability and hence is a fair trade. ðŸ™ƒ
